# Optimalish
The [Optimal Theme](https://github.com/kawaiizenbo/OptimalTheme) but with some personal preference edits that makes the UI more appealing to look at compared to the original theme.

Client mods other than Powercord have not been tested but should work (as per the original repo).

---
## Installation:

### Powercord:
- Clone this repo into your themes folder (`<powercord directory>/src/Powercord/themes`).
- Install [Theme Toggler](https://github.com/redstonekasi/theme-toggler) *(optional)* to manage your installed theme(s).

### BetterDiscord:
> Place `Optimal.theme.css` into your themes folder *(untested)*.
